- Main idea: Single page web application that can act as a powerful osu storyboard editor

General:
- All layout bars are draggable for resizing
- Light mode and dark mode
  - Tier2: Custom theming / theme files
- Gonna need documentation

Sidebar:
- Tabs are variable size, think about dealing with overflow

Text editor / Scripting:
- Lua
- Standard Library Functions
- Typing the word "gettime" or something and pressing enter will replace itself
with the current time in the render window
Scripts / resources panel:
- Double clicking a script will open said file in text editor, adding a tab in
the side panel

Timeline:
- Similar to video editing software
- "group by": resources, scripts

Render preview:
- Clicking a resource will highlight the hitbox, anchor, and any sort of path/trajectory
  - How to visualize easing functions?
- Shown resources are "locked" by default, with a right click menu option or keyboard shortcut
  available to "unlock" and allow dragging around or deleting, changes will be reflected in the script
  - "Unlocking" might be a challenge, definitely a 2nd tier feature

Keyboard shortcuts:
- Switch between sidebar tabs (files directory, resources, script)
- Insert current time in render preview
- 

Import/export:
- Import is for images
- Export will export a zip file with all images and the .osb
- Save will download a single file to the user that can be used with "Open project"
  - Need to figure out if this is possible, embedding pictures is pretty much a must
    for usability.

Lua:
- 


Tech stack:
- Svelte
- Layout: GoldenLayout / Mosaic / React-resizable-panels
- Text editor: Monaco to start, see if I can get performance gains with CodeMirror
               while hooking up the advanced features that Monaco has out of the box
  - Lua LSP: Monaco has it built in, CodeMirror needs codemirror-lsp
- Timeline: React Flow / Konva / Custom solution
  - this might be the trickiest to implement without being sluggish,
    wonder if PixiJS can handle this as well?

- Render preview: PixiJS
- File handling: File Access API / JSZip(?)
- State management: Zustand
